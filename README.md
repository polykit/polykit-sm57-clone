# SM57 microphone clone casing

This repository contains a 3d printable case for a cheap SM57 clone microphone capsule. In addition there is a transformer and a XLR jack needed.

It is based on the desgin from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4326973

I made it bigger that the transformer fits also in the case.
