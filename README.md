# SM57 microphone clone casing

This repository contains a 3d printable case for a cheap SM57 clone microphone capsule. In addition there is a transformer and a XLR jack needed.

It is based on the desgin from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4326973

I made it bigger so that the transformer also fits into the housing.

There is a short video on the build: https://makertube.net/w/j7rWkP2mXZMhz7ifYNt2s5
